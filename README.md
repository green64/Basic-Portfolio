[Basic Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)

This site is my first boot camp project. On a personal level, it represents the first step toward moving completely into web development, a discipline I've worked in part time or intermittently throughout my career. 

When I've worked for nonprofits or small companies, I've had many opportunities to utilize skills I learned on my own time  ... HTML, social media, managing websites with CMS, etc. More recently, I worked at Sprint, where I focused primarily on content writing and implementation.

I missed the excitement and constant evolution of web development, so I see my boot camp education as a necessary step to catch up as well as acquire new skills. I love learning -- then putting my new skills to work. I can't wait to see what I'm capable of by July.
